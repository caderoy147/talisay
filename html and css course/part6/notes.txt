THE HTML STRUCTURE

<!DOCTYPE html> --> tellss browers use verion latest of html

<html> --> container you can say == entire web page



  <head> --> some code like the tabs not visible on page
    <title>youtube</title>

  </head>

  
  <body> -- the body actualy inside of a page all visible elements
    
  </body>



</html> == desing to contain one body one head.

notice elemnts are within elements. this is called nesting


in this model we create a new file called styles.css
to connet them to our html 
wenn need to use void elements such as <link> no closing tag

CSS SHOULD BE AT HEAD

href = "styles.css" --> this means search beside so same directory
if othjer folder you'll need to specify

is styles was on a stles folder
then 

href="styles/styles.css" ---> file paths


fonts can be used from the internet search google fonts and copy paste iot to the head
