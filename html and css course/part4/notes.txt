CSS BOX MODEL
so height and width. thse are absolute spaces cotrolled by the borders
if the text is tooo large it overflows.
in box model we donts use height/width
we use padding or the space widthin the box
streaching the area not the parimeter

vertical-align: top; //we use the box itself to align
html by default is text alinged

basically box model dont used height. just visualize boxes
