#HOVERS, TRANSITIONS, SHADOWS

  .subscribe-button:hover{
    
  }

as you can see this means that the styles applied here will only appear
when we hover to the button

hover:{} any many oder is know as puesdo-class

:active{} - when you click an element

btw opacity is a neet trick to make it appearlighter
basically its reduing the amount of colors. it's value is 0-1 so 0.7 valid
1 being normal. and 0 completly see through. opacity  = fade out

well this is good but in desing the transistion happens too fast. its ugly so
we mange it by using TRANSITIONS
transistion: opacity 1s;
so syntax is what to transiotn or what style? then 2nd is for how long?

for multiple trasitions     
transition: background-color 1s,
    color 1s;

always put transitions on the base css style

SHADOWS - just another css property
box-shadow: a b c black
a-horizontal pos
b-vertical pos
c- blur
