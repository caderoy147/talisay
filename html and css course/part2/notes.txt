CSS meaning cascading style sheets make you html pretty


<style>
  
</style>

css code is written their and bellow is html

<style>
  button{
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>

button{} there is called css sylectors so which element are we targetting
in that case all button will become red

background-color: red; --> css property what are you changing
property : value; --> semicolon just like regular code


<button class="subscribe-button">
  SUBSCRIBE
</button>

class attributes are like vairbles. anyways they label elements so we can differentait
which to target

to tagert a class its like:

.subscribe-button{
  you styels. anyways notice the .
}

mutiple elemts can have the same class 

so button2 class ="a1"
buttopn 3, 4, 5, class ="a1" is allowed
